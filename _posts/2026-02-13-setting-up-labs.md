## Why I built this lab
To understand **Network Security** I decided to move away from local VMs and deploy a dedicated environment on **GCP Azure and AWS**

### The Architecture
I am running on an instance named *lab1*. My goals for the setup include:
1. Configuring hardened reverse proxy
2. 2. Hosting technical document via github pages.


### Lessons Learnt
I encountered issues with **bitlocker** encrypted files on my local machine
